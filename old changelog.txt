0.9.2

bug fixes:
 * fixed crash if trying to open a file locked by another application 
   (Now shows error message)
 * pasting a corrupt slot now correctly keeps the slot flagged as corrupt

new/changed features:
 * data validation is done via xxHash64 File Hash Algorithm - can now edit 
   contents of SRAM data :D
 * corrupt slots (shown in red) are now judged to be corrupt if the stored 
   hash does not match the calculated hash (rather than the old 0.9.1 method 
   i.e. if hash is equal to zero)
 * added button to change SRAM size of the chosen slot
 * added button to recalculate hash of current slot
 * added messages if imported SRAM data is of a different size to the SRAM 
   data in the chosen slot
 * added message allowing user to force imported SRAM data to be the latest 
   version
 * changed "Validation" checkbox to a toggle for Advanced features
 * added Save As feature
 * added SRAM size to each line in the list which contains SRAM data
 * can change Game Number of empty slot (i.e. create a blank SRAM slot for a 
   chosen game)


0.9.1

bug fixes:
 * fixed crash when trying to load data that includes save state slot 4 for 
   game 6

new features:
 * added ability to open/edit 2nd File, this allows user to copy & paste slots 
   between different save.bin files.

0.9

initial version:
 * can open and save any save.bin or *.ggmsav
 * can copy/paste/clear slots in save.bin
 * can export SRAM data for use in emulators (etc)
 * data validation is unknown - untick "Validation" to test advanced features 
   that will currently corrupt the slot:
    > import SRAM
    > Change Game number/Save slot number/version number
